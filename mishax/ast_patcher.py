class ModuleASTPatcher(Callable[[], ContextManager[None]]):
  """Creates a patcher that applies a series of patches to a module.

  The patched module members are in a separate temporary source file, visible to
  stacktraces and debuggers.

  `prefix` is code that should be run at the top of the file.

  For each object, the patches are logically a sequence of pairs (before, after)
  to match and replace; the patcher will error if there isn't at least one match
  (exactly one, unless more are specified via `settings`).
  For formatting convenience, the patcher will also accept a list of source
  blocks in alternating (before1, after1, before2, after2) order.

  The patcher may then be used as a `with patcher():` context manager, or using
  `patcher.install()` or `patcher.install_clean()`. These are in increasing
  order of robustness, and decreasing order of flexibility:
    * the `patcher()` context manager is flexible and useful for prototyping or
      debugging, but it changes and unchanges the target module, which isn't
      threadsafe.
    * `install_clean()` applies the patches on the target module as it's
      imported, which ensures consistency but requires the module to be
      specified as a string and not already imported.
    * `install()` is between the two. It's threadsafe, and can be called at any
      time by downstream code, but may occasionally produce incorrect results
      due to aliasing by other modules.

  NOTE: Patching a module on the source level may produce surprises additional
  to those implicitly mentioned above:
  1. If the target module is changed (e.g. via a version upgrade) then the patch
  could fail to apply, or (worse) apply but with changed meaning depending on
  the underlying code changes. Normally code maintainers will give consideration
  to downstream code by being careful with changes to the interface (e.g., type
  signatures), but will assume significant freedom in changing the
  implementation if the resulting behaviour is unchanged. However, this will
  still break patches, which depend on the implementation rather than the
  interface -- so even careful maintainers are under no obligation not to break
  patches.
  2. If the target module member definitions change global state (e.g. by
  registering themselves somewhere) then that state change will happen again
  when the patch is applied.

    may .install_clean(), then later .install(), and enter a __call__() context,
